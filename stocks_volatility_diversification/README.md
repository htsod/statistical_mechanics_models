## Stocks Volatility Diversification

This analysis models the S&P 500 index as a function of random fluctuations and varying lag times. Let $P(t)$ represent the S&P 500 score at time $t$. We aim to understand how the index changes over a specified lag period, $l$, by defining:

$$ P_{l}(t) = 100 \frac{P(t+l) - P(t)}{P(t)} $$

For short lag times, index variations generally follow a Gaussian distribution centered around a mean of zero. The relative weights of stocks reflect the economic structure, which typically does not change dramatically in the absence of major external events.

However, during significant events, the S&P 500 responds in non-random ways, as seen around the year 2000 during the World Trade Center attacks.

### Lag time

For shorter lag times, stock fluctuations are primarily driven by random investor behavior, leading to a sharp Gaussian distribution.

As lag time increases, such as shifting from daily to weekly observations, the fluctuations still follow a Gaussian distribution, but with a larger standard deviation. Even though the deviation increases, the distribution remains Gaussian. Over longer lag times, such as a year, behavior becomes more chaotic. This transition may be interpreted as a combination of random fluctuations and time-dependent external factors.



### Volatility

With increasing lag time, the standard deviation of fluctuations grows. Economists refer to this rise in standard deviation with lag time as an increase in volatility, defined by:

$$ v_{l} = \sqrt{\langle(P_{l}(t)- \bar{P_{l}(t)}^{2})\rangle} $$

The plot below illustrates this relationship:

### Invest strategy

In investing, as shown in the observations above, short-term fluctuations are largely unpredictable without insider information. To reduce risk, an investor may diversify their portfolio, which involves allocating funds across stocks in different industries. This strategy can help mitigate overall volatility and reduce exposure to unpredictable market fluctuations.
