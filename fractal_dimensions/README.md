## Fractal Dimensions

Here to study the fractal dimensions of strange sets, we use the logistic mapping as our example.

$$ f(x) = 4\mu x (1-x) $$

Here we use three known approaches to measure the dimensionality of the strange set.

- information dimension


- capacity dimension


- Hausdorff dimension / Fractal dimension
