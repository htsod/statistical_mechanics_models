## Invariant Measure

Here, we will be studying the evolution of non-hamiltonian system, which is again the logistic mapping. One reason this is a good math model to study is because by twigging the system parameter $\mu$, the evolution of the system displays different kind of dynamical behavior.

### Solving the problem

- Attracting fixed point

For $\mu < \frac{1}{4}$, the trajector has a fixed point at $x^{\ast}=0$

If $1/4 <\mu < 3/4$, there is a non-zero fixed point.

For $3/4 < \mu < (1+\sqrt{6})/4$, the trajectory has a stable, period-two cycle.

If $\mu = 1$, the trajectory explore all the configuration with unequal probability. That would suggest that the dynamics is ergodic but does not follow from Liouville's theorem.

Since each configuration has different weight, we would like to know the weight density, or calling it the invariant density.

It does cover the whole domain with weights tilt towards the ends. Things become tricky when $\mu$ is slightly less than $1$, cusps in the invariant density would appear.

Next, we will be studying how the invariant density varies as $\mu$ slightly increases from 0.8 to 1. Initially, we would observe a double peaks in the density suggesting there is a period two cycle. As $\mu$ increases, the invariant density doubles in its periodicity and eventually becomes noise. This is also known as the onset to chaos, where the final configuration depends sensitively to the initial configuration.

### Possible extension

The concept of the invariant measure is very useful when we studying a system with known configuration but with a unpredictable trajectories like that of the logistic mapping. It gives a qualitative description to a complicated system. We can thus design a numerical program that take in a function that descripts a particular system and output the corresponding invariant measure.
