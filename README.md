# Computational Solutions from Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity by James Sethna

This repository contains my solutions to various computational problems from the book Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity by James Sethna. The problems explore fascinating applications of statistical mechanics both within and beyond physics. In addition to the solutions, I have attempted to apply some of these concepts to real-world situations.

In this README, you will find:
- A concise overview of key statistical mechanics concepts.

- An introduction to each computational problem tackled.



## Key Concepts in Statistical Mechanics

1. *Ensemble*

In statistical mechanics, ensembles bridge microscopic laws and macroscopic phenomena. An ensemble treats a macroscopic system as a collection of similarly prepared microscopic systems, allowing us to study the system’s statistical properties.

2. *Entropy*

Entropy quantifies the uncertainty in a system, and as a function of probability distribution \\(p_{i}\\), it satisfies:

Maximum at \\(p_{i} = \frac{1}{N}\\)
Minimum at \\(p_{i} = 0\\) with \\(S = 0\\)
Minimum at \\(p_{i} = 1\\) with \\(S = 0\\)
The unique function that meets these conditions is \\(S = -\sum p_{i} \log{p_{i}}\\), which leads to the information interpretation of entropy. From the first condition, we see that entropy is maximized when the distribution is more even, or more "mixed," aligning with the disorder interpretation of entropy. When entropy is zero, the probability distribution is either \\(0\\) or \\(1\\), meaning that we can reproduce the system with certainty. As entropy increases, reproducing the system becomes less likely, giving rise to the concept of irreversibility.

3. *Quantum Statistical Mechanics*

Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic evolution of systems, influencing particle behavior. At high temperatures, quantum effects are negligible, and particles behave like ideal gases. As temperatures drop, quantum states become more distinct, leading to non-classical phenomena.

4. *Monte Carlo*

Monte Carlo methods are computational tools that calculate ensemble averages in complex systems, essential for statistical mechanics. These stochastic techniques help simulate systems where analytical solutions are not feasible.

5. *Phases*

Phases are defined by their symmetries. Phase transitions occur when there’s a change in symmetry. There are two main types:

-  Abrupt phase transitions: Discontinuous changes in the first derivative of free energy.

- Continuous (or critical) phase transitions: Smooth changes, often characterized by self-similarity and scale invariance at critical temperatures.

6. *Fluctuations and Correlations*

The correlation function measures the alignment of states in a system, revealing crucial information about its internal structure and response. Fluctuations are tied to these correlations and play a key role in phase transitions.

7. *Abrupt Phase Transition*
An abrupt phase transition is marked by a sudden change in the system’s properties, where free energy is equal at the phase boundary but differs on either side.

8. *Criticality*

In continuous phase transitions, a system’s symmetry changes smoothly. At the critical temperature, fluctuations dominate, and the system exhibits self-similarity and scale invariance, a universal phenomenon seen across various physical systems.
